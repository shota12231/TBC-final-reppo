        <h1>Most streamed Rock songs on Spotify</h1>
        <p>Since its launch as a humble Swedish start-up in 2008, Spotify has grown to become the biggest streaming
            platform in the world. And love it or hate it,
            Spotify is an important metric of success in the modern music industry. Drake became the first artist to
            achieve a billion streams for a single song, with
            One Dance in 2016. Since then, a total of 446 songs have passed that same milestone, with two – The
            Weeknd’s Blinding Lights and Ed Sheeran’s Shape
            Of You surpassing an incredible 3 billion plays each. When it comes to rock music, and especially legacy
            rock music, there are questions of
            demographic and preference at play. Nearly two thirds of Spotify’s users are aged under 35 and rock fans are
            more likely than others to listen to
            traditional radio and music on physical formats. The average age of the Spotify user is creeping up though
            and streaming is now by far the most
            common method of music consumption across all combined age groups. Queen are the best-performing rock band
            to have joined Spotify’s Billions
            Club. The 2011 remaster of Bohemian Rhapsody is currently sitting pretty at nearly 2.2 billion streams and
            they also have another four tracks in the list.
            Elsewhere, AC/DC have three billion-streamers in Back In Black, Highway To Hell and Thunderstruck. Notable
            by their absence are monsters of rock
            like the Rolling Stones, whose best-performing track Paint It Black is just shy of 938 million streams,
            the Foo Fighters (with Everlong on more than
            886m) and Led Zeppelin (846m for Stairway To Heaven).</p>

            <h1>Coachella 2024</h1>
            <p>This year's Coachella event began attracting negative publicity even
                before the doors opened last Friday. In January, SFGate reported that
                Coachella 2024 was beset by the festival's slowest ticket sales in a
                decade. Things picked up, but according to Billboard, only 80% of the
                250,000 tickets available sold out before the festival began, which is "14%
                -17% down" on last year. </p>

            <h1>Guitars at auction</h1>
            <p>If there’s one Kurt Cobain guitar moment that’s become even more iconic
                than the Teen Spirit video, it’s Nirvana’s incredible bittersweet
                performance on MTV Unplugged. Kurt bought the D-18E in 1992at Voltage
                Guitars in Los Angeles, and it’s a rare bird for Martin guitars in that it
                came out of the factory with the DeArmond pickups. Guitar sold out for
                $6,010,000. </p>

            <h1>The Dark Side of the Moon</h1>
            <p>The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock
                band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records in the UK
                and Capitol Records in the US. After Half a Century, 'The Dark Side of the
                Moon' Still Reverberates. Pink Floyd's enduring blockbuster merged
                grandeur and malaise. Very much a product of its era, it became one of
                the best-selling albums of all time. </p>
